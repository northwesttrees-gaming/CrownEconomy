# About
Our main goal is to add a NeoForge economy mod that works for both single-player and multi-player which can support other mods and mod pack creators. Using the power of MCreator and the File Manager plugin for MCreator we have created a customizable economy mod experience with both single-player and multiplayer in mind. We hope you enjoy the mod, if you find any problems please let us know on our issue tracker so we can work on a patch for any issues. You may also use the issue tracker to share your feature requests as well.
# Economy
This mod is driven by customizable JSON files which mod pack creators and other mod creators can edit. The mod has many settings that allow a dynamic economic experience for your single-player or multi-player worlds.
# Anti-Grief Protection
In our mod you can buy land in the form of world chunks, in the case you have anti-griefing enabled players are protected from most common direct griefing, though not fully covered compared to some mods, it does provide a lot of anti-grief mechanics from blocking entity damage and entity griefing, direct block placement or breaking by players, right-click prevention on blocks and entities, and much more. We continue to improve the protection as we discover more ways to prevent damage in patches.
